# 4. Actions

We have been using get and contains to test for the presence of elements, but we can also use this to interact with elements on the website.

### click

In order to click a link or button, we need to get and click it:

```text
cy.get("a").contains("Actions").click()
```

Run the command and you will see the "Actions" button has been clicked and we are on a new page.

Try cy.get\("a"\).click\(\) and read the error message.
