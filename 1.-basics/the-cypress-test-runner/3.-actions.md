# 4. Actions

We have been using get and contains to test for the presence of elements, but we can also use this to interact with elements on the website.

### click

In order to click a link or button, we need to get and click it:

```text
cy.get("a").contains("Actions").click()
```

Run the command and you will see the "Actions" button has been clicked and we are on a new page.

Try running:

```text
cy.get("a").click()
```

 and read the error message. There are multiple links on the page and Cypress assumes you only want to click one

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need to be on the "Actions" page for the next parts, so make sure the test clicks on the "Actions" link 
{% endhint %}

### type/clear

Type into a text field and clear it:

```text
cy.get("#email").type("Words")
cy.get("#email").clear()
```

### submit

Submit a form:

TODO: is this needed? There is always a button you can click to submit the form...

```text
cy.get("#couponCode1").submit()
```

### check/uncheck

Check a checkbox and uncheck it:

```text
cy.get("[value=checkbox1]").check()
cy.get("[value=checkbox1]").uncheck()
```

### select

Select an option from a dropdown:

```text
cy.get('.action-select').select('apples')
```
