# 1. Configuration

### baseUrl

Set your baseUrl in cypress.json so you don't have to type it everytime in visit.

```text
{
    baseUrl: 'https://example.cypress.io/'
}
```

Now you do not need to enter the url to visit the homepage:

```text
visit();
```

### Custom directory structure

Cypress looks for tests in the cypress/integration directory by default. If you have custom directory structure, add this in cypress.json to point cypress to the location of those directories:

```text
{
    integrationFolder: 'test/cypress/specs'
}
```
