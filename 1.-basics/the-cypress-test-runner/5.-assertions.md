# 5. Assertions

### should

Assertions are used for testing:

```text
cy.get("h1").should("have.text", "Kitchen Sink")
```

The "should" verifies that the element "h1" has a certain text "Kitchen Sink". You might think this is similar to:

```text
cy.get("h1").contains("Kitchen Sink")
```

which verifies the existence of a header element containing "Kitchen Sink".  However, the assertion would fail if there are _more_ "h1" elements. Try for instance:

```text
cy.get("h2").should("have.text", "Commands")
```

The test fails because Cypress checks that ALL "h2" element texts combined equals "Commands". However, this would pass:

```text
cy.get("h2").contains("Commands")
```

because there is an "h2" element which contains "Commands".

### Numbers

We can test that there is only one "h1" element on the page:

```text
cy.get("h1").should("have.length", 1)
```
